## About Me

Hi, I am Qianhua, from Guangzhou CN and lives in Munich DE.

At job, I am an supply chain consultant specialized in supply chain planning and digital transformation. 

Beside my job, I am a technology enthusiast who keeps exploring the tech world. 

This blog is a place to document random thoughts, share my learnings, and hopefully someday my own applications.

I write sometimes in Chinese, sometimes in English, and maybe very seldom in German.
