## About Me

Hi, I am Qianhua.

Born and raised in Guangzhou CN, living in Munich DE.

I know a bit about supply chain, and a bit about SAP. 

I spend quite some time in the mountains, in the kitchen, and on my bike. 

Dream in Cantonese, think in Mandarin, work in German and English, and learning Spanish. 

With this blog, I am trying first to communicate with myself, and second with whomever that happens to relate. 

Cheers.
